[002]: Submitted by @Colen

Given a list of 200 random integer points (x,y) where |x|≤20 and |y|≤20 find all rectangles that are parallel to either the x or y axis. Return the number of rectangles found as an integer.

Extension: Find all possible rectangles, including those not parallel to either the x or y axis.

Notes:
- Degenerate rectangles/squares do not count (Ie those of 0 area).
- The extension challenge will be ranked separately.
